            <h1>British Security Services</h1>
            
            <p>The British Security Services consists primarily of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Mi6.gov.uk/">MI6/SIS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> and

            <h2>Elizabeth Lydia Manningham-Buller</h2>

            <p>My name is Eamonn Duffy, I am Irish, and I am a Software Engineer by Trade.</p>

            <p>I was working in England, and my Boss at the time, George, was arrested on Suspected Money Laundering in mid-August 2001 (charges that were later dropped in early 2003).</p>

            <p>Shortly after his arrest, the September 11th 2001 attacks happened in America.</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="Adversaries/Elizabeth_Lydia_Manningham_Buller-www.Wikipedia.org-2022_08_14.jpg">Elizabeth Lydia Manningham-Buller</a> and
               the British Security Services wrongly accused me (with no evidence) of being an International Terrorist at that stage, and wrongly accused me (again, with no evidence)
               of being involved with the September 11th 2001 attacks.</p>

            <p>The British Security Services have persecuted me since, including them engaging in Human Rights Violations and perhaps either Criminal Activity or Aiding and Abetting Criminal Activity.</p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that as a young, idealistic, Electronic Engineering Student in the National Institute for Higher Education (N.I.H.E.) College in Dublin (later to become
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Dcu.ie/">Dublin City University (DCU)</a>) that I fell under the influence of a lecturer who was a known IRA sympathiser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that over many years I worked with him on specialised and highly technical Digital Electronic and Digital Signal Processing projects for the IRA initially, including
                    Advanced Mobile and Satellite Telephone Communications, Compression/Decompression and Encryption/Decryption, amongst other things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that I later worked with the Libyans through IRA contacts, and even learned Arabic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that because of my time working with the Libyans, I contacted Al Qaeda in the 1990s, and began working with them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that since 2001/2002 <i>either</i> I have been hiding the fact that I was a Terrorist <i>or</i> I have continued working with Al Qaeda.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A suggestion is that I have also been involved in illicit (e.g. Terrorist and/or Criminal) activity on the Dark Web.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>None of these suggestions are true.</p>

            <p>I am not a Terrorist, International or otherwise, nor a Criminal, and never have been.</p>
